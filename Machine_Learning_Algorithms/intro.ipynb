    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to learn from data and improve \n",
    "their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for every specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work?\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data: You give the model a dataset with features (like height, weight, age) and sometimes labels (like “has disease” or “does not have disease”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: The model analyzes the data to learn relationships between features and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: After training, you can give new data, and the model can predict or classify it based on what it learned.\n",

    "MACHINE LEARNING VS TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING\n",
    "=============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Traditional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You write explicit instructions (code) that tell the computer exactly what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You define the rules, logic, and steps to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data goes in, and the program follows the written steps to produce output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of explicitly programming rules, you give data to a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns patterns or rules from the data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You provide inputs and expected outputs (in supervised learning), and the ML model figures out the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the model can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n"
